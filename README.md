# Lightweight Fine-Tuning of a Foundation Model

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to apply lightweight fine-tuning techniques to a pretrained foundation model using Hugging Face's ecosystem. We use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), to fine-tune large language models efficiently with fewer computational resources. This approach is particularly valuable for tasks like text classification, where deploying smaller, fine-tuned models can lead to faster and more efficient inference.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Load and Evaluate a Pretrained Model**: We load a pretrained Hugging Face model and evaluate its performance on a sequence classification task using the IMDB dataset.
2. **Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: We use LoRA to fine-tune the model on the same task. This method reduces the number of trainable parameters, thus lowering the computational cost.
3. **Evaluate the Fine-Tuned Model**: We compare the performance of the fine-tuned model to the baseline to assess the impact of fine-tuning.
4. **Visualize Results**: We provide visualizations to demonstrate the improvement in performance after fine-tuning.

## Prerequisites
