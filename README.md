# Lightweight Fine-Tuning of a Foundation Model

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to apply lightweight fine-tuning techniques to a pretrained foundation model using Hugging Face's ecosystem. We use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), to fine-tune large language models efficiently with fewer computational resources. This approach is particularly valuable for tasks like text classification, where deploying smaller, fine-tuned models can lead to faster and more efficient inference.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Load and Evaluate a Pretrained Model**: We load a pretrained Hugging Face model and evaluate its performance on a sequence classification task using the IMDB dataset.
2. **Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: We use LoRA to fine-tune the model on the same task. This method reduces the number of trainable parameters, thus lowering the computational cost.
3. **Evaluate the Fine-Tuned Model**: We compare the performance of the fine-tuned model to the baseline to assess the impact of fine-tuning.
4. **Visualize Results**: We provide visualizations to demonstrate the improvement in performance after fine-tuning.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- `transformers` library from Hugging Face
- `datasets` library from Hugging Face
- `peft` library for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
- `bitsandbytes` library for quantization
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft bitsandbytes matplotlib seaborn

## Dataset

We use the IMDB dataset for binary sentiment classification. This dataset is available through Hugging Face Datasets and can be loaded directly using the `datasets` library.

## Model and Fine-Tuning Technique

- **Model**: `bert-base-uncased` from Hugging Face Model Hub
- **Fine-Tuning Technique**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

LoRA is chosen for its ability to fine-tune large language models with fewer parameters, making the process more efficient in terms of both time and computational resources.

└── results/                      # Directory to save fine-tuned model and logs

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lightweight-fine-tuning.git
cd lightweight-fine-tuning

### Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open `LightweightFineTuning.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook LightweightFineTuning.ipynb

### Follow the Steps in the Notebook:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Load the pretrained model and perform baseline evaluation.
3. Apply the LoRA fine-tuning method to adapt the model.
4. Evaluate the fine-tuned model and visualize the results.

## Results

The fine-tuned model demonstrates a noticeable improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline model. The project provides a comprehensive visualization of performance metrics before and after fine-tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of the LoRA technique.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different PEFT configurations and other datasets to evaluate the robustness of the fine-tuning approach.
- Apply the fine-tuning method to other NLP tasks beyond sentiment classification, such as named entity recognition (NER) or text summarization.
